Brandeis Math 162a: Code Examples
Unit 0: Overview of Scientific Computing 
========================================
acc_test.py - a program to test the value of machine epsilon, by comparing
how small a value of h is needed before 1+h evaluates to the same as 1.

acc_test.cc - a version of acc_test.py written in C++. With the GNU C++
compiler, the program can be compiled with "g++ -o acc_test acc_test.cc" and
then run with "./acc_test". It finds the same value of h as the Python
version, emphasizing that what is being tested is due to the hardware-level
implementation of floating point arithmetic, as opposed to being due to the
specific programming language. 

calc_pi_double.py - a program that uses Taylor series expansions (e.g. the Gregory
and Machin series) to approximate pi in standard double precision arithmetic.

calc_pi2.py - a version of calc_pi_double.py that approximates pi to 
arbitrary precision.

The lectures also discussed paranoia.c, originally written by Prof. William
Kahan (UC Berkeley), available here:

This C program performs a number of tests to ensure that the computer's
arithmetic system does not have any errors.
