Brandeis Math 232a: Code Examples
=======================================
Brandeis Math 232a is a graduate course that provides a broad overview of scientific computing.

This Git repository contains example codes from the course. The codes are
primarily written in Python, and make use of several commonly-used libraries

- NumPy for numerical linear algebra (www.numpy.org)
- SciPy for scientific routines and algorithms (www.scipy.org)
- Matplotlib for graphing and visualization (matplotlib.org)

Organization
============
The course is divided into six units:

- Unit 0: Overview of Scientific Computing
- Unit 1: Data Fitting
- Unit 2: Numerical Linear Algebra
- Unit 3: Quadrature
- Unit 4: Numerical Methods for Ordinary Differential Equations
- Unit 5: Numerical Methods for Partial Differential Equations

In addition there is a separate Python tutorial.

Example codes from each unit are provided in separate directories.
