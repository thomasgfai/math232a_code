Brandeis Math 232a: Code Examples
Unit 5: Numerical Partial Differential Equations
==========================
poisson.py - Solves the two-dimensional Poisson equation using a linear solve
of a finite-difference discretization.

m_of_lines.py - Demonstrates the method of lines for the linear advection
equation, whereby the spatial grid is discretized but the system is
time-integrated using a black-box ODE integration routine.

transp.py - Solves the linear advection equation using a first-order scheme
with an upwinded one-sided derivative.

transp2.py - Solves the linear advection equation using a second-order 
centered-difference scheme to calculate the spatial derivative. 
This scheme is slightly unstable, which becomes apparent after many 
timesteps have been performed.

heat.py - Solves the heat equation on a periodic unit interval using an
explicit finite difference scheme.

c-n.py - Solves the heat equation using the Crank-Nicolson method, which is
second-order in space and time, and unconditionally stable.

telegraph.py - Solves the telegraph equation using the method of lines 
and compares to the limiting exact solution of the heat equation

fsolve.py - Demonstrates Python's "fsolve" routine for finding the nodes and
weights in the two-point Gauss quadrature scheme.

h_newton.py - Finds critical points of the Himmelblau function using the
Newton method.
