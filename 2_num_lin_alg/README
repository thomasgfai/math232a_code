Brandeis Math 232a: Code Examples
Unit 2: Numerical Linear Algebra
================================
norm.py - Demonstrates how the value of the norm ||x||_p changes as a function
of p, for an arbitrary vector x.

timing_test.py - Demonstrates two different timing routines in Python: the
"clock" function for measuring processor time, and "time" function for
measuring wall clock time.

lu_time.py - Measures the time taken by Python's LU factorization routine, as
a function of the matrix size. (Note that Python's linear algebra routines are
based on the LAPACK library (http://www.netlib.org/lapack/, a highly
optimized library for dense matrix calculations.)

chol_time.py - Measures the time taken by Python's Cholesky factorization
routine, as a function of the matrix size. 

power_method.py - Demonstrates the shifted power method for extracting
an eigenvector of a matrix.

qr_example.py - Demonstrates the QR method for finding eigenvalues and
eigenvectors.
