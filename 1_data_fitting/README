Brandeis Math 232a: Code Examples
Unit 1: Data Fitting
====================
vander_cond.txt - a transcript of an interactive Python session using NumPy to
evaluate the condition number of several different Vandermonde matrices

v_inter.py - a Python program to do Vandermonde polynomial interpolation,
outputting the results and error to text, which can be reading by other
plotting programs such as Gnuplot (www.gnuplot.info). If the program is run
with "python v_inter.py >out" so that the data is sent to a file called "out",
then within Gnuplot the results can be shown with the command:

plot 'out' u 1:3 t 'Reference curve', 'out' u 1:2 t 'Polynomial fit'

The differences between the two can be shown with the command:

plot 'out' u 1:4 t 'Interpolation differences'

v_inter2.py - a second version of v_inter.py that uses Matplotlib to plot the
results directly withing Python

ch_inter.py - a Python program to perform Lagrange interpolation using Chebyshev
or linearly-spaced points

spline.py - cubic spline test program, which can also examine the difference
between two splines with very similar input data

spline2.py - example of defining a parametric curve using two cubic splines
x(t) and y(t)

lfit.py - program to do least-squares fitting of a polynomial to samples of
cos(4*x). It uses two different methods: a direct approach based on the normal
equations (which is generally ill-conditioned) and a built-in Python routine,
lstsq, that uses a different algorithm with better conditioning. The methods
used by lstsq will be discussed later in the course.

np_lfit.py - program to do linear least squares fitting of a sum of
exponentials to a given function. This program demonstrates the the linear
least squares does not just work for polynomials.

nonlinlsq.py - a nonlinear least squares problem based on finding the position
of a radio transmitter based on signal received at nearby beacons.
